## Day 3 Project - Mobber

We were tasked to recreate a pixel perfect website from an image

We were given 2 options, an easy one called "[SURF & PADDLE CO.](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/branch/other_file.md)", and a harder 'Adventure Mode' called "MOBBER"

I had some extra time on my hand, so I did both projects.

Here's the image we were tasked to recreate:
![MOBBER website](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tiy-greenville-frontend-2016-feb/assets/master/assignments/1.4-pixel-perfect/mobber.png "Logo Title Text 1")

And here is a screenshot from my website:
![MY website](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarkLyck/TIY-day03/master/images/mlyck-mobber.png "Logo Title Text 1")

The main differences are the logo and images, we weren't given image assets, so I had to work with what I got.

We also weren't provided with the correct fonts, so all of the text is somewhat different.

The website is fully responsive. All hover links work And I have implemented a different mobile navigation barÂ with an animated hamburger icon using purely CSS.
