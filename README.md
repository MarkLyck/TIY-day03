## Day 3 Project - Mobber

We were tasked to recreate a pixel perfect website from an image

We were given 2 options, an easy one called "[SURF & PADDLE CO.](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/branch/other_file.md)", and a harder 'Adventure Mode' called "MOBBER"

I had some extra time on my hand, so I did both projects.

Here's the image we were tasked to recreate:
